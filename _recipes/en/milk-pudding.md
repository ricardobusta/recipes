## Pudim de Leite

### The Flan

Add to a bowl or a blender the condensed milk, the three eggs and use the condensed milk can to measure the amount of whole milk.
The mix the ingredients until uniform.

### The Caramel

Add 1 cup of sugar to a pan, and heat it until it melts. Once it browns a bit and is melted, add the water, and keep mixing. Once it's melted again and is thickening, it's done.

### Assemble

Add the liquid caramel to the cake mold, and wait for it to harden. Once it's not liquid enough, pour the flan mix.
Bake in the oven at around 180C for 30~45 minutes. You know it's ready by poking it with a fork.

Let it cool, and you can un-mold it into a plate for serving.
