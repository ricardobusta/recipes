## Arroz Branco

Add 1 cup of rice, salt, onion and garlic to taste to a pan

Add 2 cups of water

Max heat until boil

Once water is below the level of rice, turn of the heat, let it cook with the remaining heat in the oven and pan

Put on the lid, and wait for around 10 minutes

When you're back, rice should have absorbed the water, and now is in a soft texture
